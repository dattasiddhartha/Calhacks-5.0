Winning submisson at Cal Hacks 5.0 (Epson sponsor award). Our team developed a pair of display goggles that helps patients with Alzheimer’s or other visual/mental disabilities in locating their personal belongings. Users verbalize the item they are searching for (typically items from the COCO image dataset), and all objects detected would be highlighted.

For setup instructions, refer to [documentation](https://github.com/dattasiddhartha/Calhacks-5.0/blob/master/Moverio_Documentation.pdf).
