# Memory Palace (Calhacks 5.0 submission)

Winning submisson at Cal Hacks 5.0 (Epson sponsor award). Our team developed a pair of display goggles that helps patients with Alzheimerâ€™s or other visual/mental disabilities in locating their personal belongings. Users verbalize the item they are searching for (typically items from the COCO image dataset), and all objects detected would be highlighted.
